            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px; color: #1b3d6d;">Early Saturday morning, the campus received information on a tragic car accident in the City of Irvine involving two recent UCI alumni and two current students. Unfortunately, the two alumni did not survive the accident and the two students are still undergoing medical treatment. Our hearts ache at the tragic loss of two members of our recent Anteater alumni family and our deepest sympathies, thoughts and prayers are with all the family and friends that have been impacted by this tragedy.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px; color: #1b3d6d;">I want to take this opportunity to remind students about our UCI Counseling Center services. Students can make an appointment by calling (949) 824-6457 or they can drop in during business hours 8 a.m.-5 p.m, Monday-Friday. The UCI Counseling Center is located across Ring Road from Starbucks, in Student Services 1 next to the Career Center. For more information, visit the UCI Counseling Center website at <a href="http://www.counseling.uci.edu/">http://www.counseling.uci.edu/</a>.
</p>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px; color: #1b3d6d;">A community healing circle is gathering at the UCI Cross-Cultural Center on Monday, July 3 from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. and 2-4 p.m. Counselors will be present to provide support and information on resources.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px; color: #1b3d6d;">In this time of profound heartache and sadness, we offer prayers for eternal rest and peace of our alumni, ask for prayers for our two students who remain hospitalized, and ask for healing of the hearts, minds, and spirits of all of us touched by this tragedy. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px; color: #1b3d6d;">Sincerely,
</p>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px; color: #1b3d6d;"><strong>Thomas A. Parham, Ph.D.</strong><br>
